# Structure

1. Introduction
   - who are we
   - purpose of this session

2. Where are we?
   - state of media in Drupal 7
      - modules: Media/File entity, Scald, Asset, Media box, ...
      - what they offer
      - what is missing
      - where we failed in D7 cycle
   - what was improved in D8 core

3. Why we need great media support in Drupal...
   - media-rich websites are a must (nobody wants text-only sites any more)
   - editorial experience must be great

4. ... and why is hard?
   - very, very complex field
   - not as easy as "replicate what WP offers"; we need much much more
   - lots of different use cases
   - a lot of work to be done (coding, UX, design, documentation, project management, ...)

5. Plans for Drupal 8 
   - difference between File entity and Media entity
      - what is different
      - pros/cons of both
   - split the ecosystem in decoupled components
      - browser/entity creator/selector
      - WYSIWYG integration (GSoC)
      - parts of rendering

6. Get involved
   - why?
   - how to help?
